### Matrices 

Types of matrices 

Column (one column matrix) 

Row (one row matrix) 

Square matrix (rows=columns) 

Equal matrices – two matrices considered equal if they have same dimensions & corresponding elements are equal 

Zero matrix – contains all 0s 

Identity matrix – multiplying a matrix by its identity matrix leaves it unchanged; to create an identity matrix just have all the elements along the main diagonal set to 1 and rest to 0  

Addition & subtraction – element-wise 

Multiplcation - multiply each row by each column; or could just be scalar multiplication, in which case multiply each elem by scalar 

Matrx A * Matrix B -> # columns in A must = # rows in B; output dimensionality is # rows in A by # columns in B 

NOT COMMUTATIVE. Multiplication only commutative if A and B are both scalar values.  

Transposition – reverse order of rows & columns.  

If you transpose the transposition of a matrix M, you get the original M.  

 

Submatrix – any portion of a matrix that remains after deleting any number of rows or coumns  

 


 

Basic Algebra 

Axioms 

 


Vector length – computed with Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)  

|| vector || = sqrt( x2 + y2 + … n^2 ) 

Consider the vector [2, 3,  4]; x = 1, y = 3; so length: sqrt (4+9+16) = 5.38 

Nonnegative length is called the norm of the vector.  

Given vector v, this is written as ||v|| 

If || v || == 1, v is a unit vector
